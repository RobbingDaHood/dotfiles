# DO NOT INSTALL WITH SNAP
Ubuntu: If installing alacritty with snap, then I could only start alacritty from the terminal. I could not get hotkeys to work or anything else. 

In nixos it works out of the box. 

# REMEMBER: TO install the themes :)  

``` 
# We use Alacritty's default Linux config directory as our storage location here.
mkdir -p ~/.config/alacritty/themes
git clone https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty-theme ~/.config/alacritty/themes
```
